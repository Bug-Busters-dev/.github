# BugBusters

We’re a group of people who love solving **BWINF** problems and building projects together. Most of our time goes into BWINF, but we also have some fun side projects—like **FriendBeads**.  

## What We Do

- **BWINF**  
  This is our main focus. We are teaming up in the first Round to solve the annual Assignments and try to ensure that everybody gets into the next Round.

- **FriendBeads**  
  A side project where we explore connecting people through colored Braclets.

## How We Work

- We review each other’s code and share feedback  
- We learn from every project, big or small  
- We try to keep things organized but low-pressure  

## License

Unless otherwise noted, our code is under the MIT License.
